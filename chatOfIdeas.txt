Khain: hells we should totally make that hunger gamer thing
Khain: hunger games
HellsHero: is anyone doing hunger games? that would be fun to script
Khain: mczealot made it but guess what
HellsHero: what?
Khain: it SUCKS
poo: yea zealot is just worthless
Khain: he made some sort of VIP system where you pay to get good weapons
Khain: seriously who the fuck pulls that sort of thing in bl
poo: tezuni
Khain: tezunis a joke
HellsHero: thing is if I make it I would need a build designed for the script
Khain: lay it out
Khain: island?
Khain: what
Khain: poo makes everything
poo: no
Khain lol!!
HellsHero: ever read or watched hunger games movie/book?
Khain: no!!
poo: i red the first one
Khain: i only read harry potter sory
poo: hell ya i read all 7
Khain: movies sucked tho
HellsHero: k well you know how the arena is fashioned, in the middle there are 24 platforms equi-distant from eachother and the middle in the form of a circle
poo: i only saw the first few
HellsHero: in middle there would be goodies
HellsHero: and around that would be an environment
Khain: so a middle arena where has goodies
Khain: yeah i saw it in the movie i think
Khain: everyone spawns in the center
HellsHero: the middle is called the capricorn
Khain: then you move?
HellsHero: you move after 10 seconds of standing there, if you get out of your starting platform you blow up
HellsHero: if you get out before time is up
Khain: rude
HellsHero: soo at the start you either run away or you run to the middle and engage in a fight hopefully getting out alive with goodies
HellsHero: 1 life
HellsHero: so the arena can't be that big
HellsHero: but big enough for 24 people
Khain: you should do what i told you
Khain: planes
Khain: supplies every 3 days
Khain: people respawn every 3 days
Khain: whoever has more points at the end of the twenty fifth day wins idk
poo: i dont want to wait around 3 day to respawn
poo: i would leave
Khain: there would be some sort of afterlife
Khain: no one wants to wait that much
HellsHero: we can do it so players in the arena when they do stuff they gain score and they can spend score to get goodies, kinda
HellsHero: like getting stuff from their sponsor (this is a reference to the book)
Khain: we should totally make something related to it
HellsHero: and it would be organized in a sense that every day at certain times the hunger games would start so people can know the
HellsHero: time and only come onto the server when they are going to play
HellsHero: cause to have it work properly we will need at least 20+ people
HellsHero: so if it's an organized event with schedules there would always be people
Khain: yeah
HellsHero: have a global leaderboard (every round of the games) and a local leaderboards (the currently running game)
HellsHero: also random events will happen in the arena which try to kill the players
HellsHero: fire storm, bomb, bots, etc dunno
------------------
Khain: like coconut bomb
Khain: that would be sexy
HellsHero: we might need crafting and shit
Khain: a coconut with nails on it that explodes
HellsHero: have hunger, heat loss , thirst, etc
Khain: nails go around
poo: snake flail
poo: u tie a snake on a stick and swing it around till it bites someone
Khain: lmao thats awesome
Khain: poison effect!
Khain: and fish weapon too
Khain: hit someone 2 turn them into tuna can
poo: lmao
Khain: no srsly now you could really have magic spells to turn people into fish or other animals
Khain: also to disguise yourself as animals
Khain: man thatd be swag
Khain: so im thinking like 5 weapons?
Khain: 2 ranged ,3 melee?
Khain: idk
Khain: i thought
HellsHero: I could make a list tomorrow or whenever
Khain: Bow Throwing Knife, Sword,
Khain: Axe
HellsHero: throwing knife that can be used for melee as well
Khain: yeah
Khain: but makeshift weps
Khain: i have some ideas
Khain: what poo said is an awesome idea
Khain: the snake thing
