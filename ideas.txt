Hunger Games Systems

Aspects:

Skills & levels: every weapon will have a skill corresponding to it, certain tasks in the game will 
also have skills connected to them

Inventory: an easy to see inventory will store random non-weapons

Hunger: two levels, hunger and saturation, eat good food, stay full longer

Thirst: drink water to stay functional, bad water can get you sick

Player type: has sprinting, jump delay, shorter jump(3-4 not 5), slows down the more hungry/thirsty

Armour: using default avatar accents and models.

Leaderboards: records all kills / wins of individual games and has a 'high score' list, also records
how many people participated in said games.

Saving: saves everything on the server, records what happens in the games as well

Events: various minor to major hunger games events , fire storm, gas, explosions, etc drought,
bot spawns, acid rain, 'dinner' in the center, cold front,

Brick events: events to interact with the built world, onLoaded, brick->setItemSpawn [rarity],
brick->setFoodSpawn [rarity], etc.

Weapons: various weapons, bow with individual arrow ammo, draw speed can vary, knives, swords, maces,
pebbles, sticks, weapons have durability.

Crafting: can craft stuff from random items you find, find misc items from spawn but also by using the
search cmd, as long as you stay put in certain zones with this cmd active you will find items.

Warmth: certain clothing protects you from cold, a fire will keep you warm

Modifying environment: if you have enough clearance room you can create stuff in the world, camp fire,
bedroll, a pot, etc, these bricks spawn in with events on them onActivate->player->sleep or
onfirestarter->brick->lightfire,etc

Hunting: animal bots will wonder the games, kill them to get meat, bone and fur/skins

Director AI: manages everything, item spawns, animal spawns, events, etc. Events are determined to
occur from time elapse and # of survivors. The later in the game with more people the more dangerous
the event.

GUI: chicken nuggets, water droplets, hearts, arrow selection (arrow graphic showing type.of arrow
to use), inventory screen, leaderboards menu, scheduling calendar

Schedule: depending how long the games end up averaging out to, there will be scheduled games set
periodically throughout the day the games might only start when there is 24 ppl

--------------------------------------------------------

Zones will be everywhere on blocks and around vital locations, around water sources, around
crafting stations, etc

To set zones, events will take charge, onLoaded->brick->createzone [type] [xyz]
Type can be water source, murky water source, crafting table, camp fire, fire, salt water,
forest floor, stones, mushroom patch, etc.

Hunger Games - What must be done for Alpha Testing
What must be ready before some testing can be done?
Saving, leaderboards, player type, basic inventory, basic non zone searching, some events such as
onloaded, setitemspawn,


Various things that would be better to have a visual but still function without, ex: acid rain,
weapons, camp fire, bedroll, heating water, etc

Instead of an ai there could be servercmds to initialize stuff.

No clientside for hotkeys and potential GUI elements

No scheduling, alpha testing will be used to try and discover the average game time to help future
schedules.
